// The order state machine, exhaustively (TEST-PLAN D5).
//
// Every status-gated function in PorterOrders, against every status an order can
// hold. The invariant campaign reaches some of these incidentally — it walks
// random operations and would eventually try a cancel on a delivered order —
// but "eventually, on some seeds" is not the same claim as "never, on any
// path". This is the explicit version: 13 actions × 8 statuses = **104 cells**,
// each one asserted.
//
// Two things make it worth more than its size suggests.
//
// **Every call is valid apart from its status.** The point of a cell is that
// the STATUS is what rejected it, so each action is invoked by the right caller
// with the right arguments and enough setup to reach the status check. A test
// that called `cancelAssigned` as a stranger would pass on `not-customer` and
// prove nothing about the state machine — the same failure mode that makes most
// such matrices decorative (and see §5 C3, which had to solve it for
// authorization).
//
// **The table is checked against the contract.** A new status-gated function,
// or a widened guard, breaks no other test in the repo: no other suite calls
// that function in that status. It breaks the completeness check here.

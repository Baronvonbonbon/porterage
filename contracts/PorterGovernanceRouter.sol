///
///         Clients (web app, integrators, other contracts) resolve live
///         addresses from `currentAddrOf[name]` instead of hardcoding, so
///         an upgrade is one transaction and every consumer follows.
///
///         Upgrade flow (freeze-and-drain, see PorterUpgradable):
///           1. deploy v2, wire its config
///           2. `upgradeContract(name, v2, freezeOld)`
///              → optionally freeze v1 (entry mutators blocked, exits open)
///              → v2.migrate(v1) copies cheap state (records, not escrow)
///              → registry re-points, version bumps
///           3. operator re-points cached refs in dependent contracts
///              (e.g. `orders.configure`) — same posture as DATUM, where
///              cached references are updated via setter post-upgrade.
///
///         Ownership is the governance ladder: deployer → Safe/council →
///         (if ever needed) conviction governance. Ownable2Step so the
///         handoff can't fat-finger to a dead address.

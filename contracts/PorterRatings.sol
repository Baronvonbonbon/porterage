/// @notice Verified-delivery ratings. A customer may rate the driver and the
///         venue for an order ONLY after that order is `Delivered`, and only for
///         an order they placed — the "verified purchase" gate that keeps the
///         aggregates honest. You cannot review-bomb without actually completing
///         (and paying for) deliveries; each order rates once.
///
///         Ratings are 1–5 stars; 0 = skip that target. Aggregates are stored as
///         (sum, count) per driver and per venue — clients compute sum/count.
///
///         Works with the per-order burner wallets: the order's `customer`
///         address (a fresh burner) is the authorized rater, so **no persistent
///         identity is required** — the gate is the *order*, not the account.
///         Aggregates accumulate across many one-shot burner raters.
///
///         Residual abuse (self-dealing: order from your own venue with a
///         colluding driver, deliver, self-rate) is bounded by the same economics
///         as the rest of the protocol — a real pickup+dropoff cosign is required,
///         and phantom deliveries map onto existing fraud shapes (see docs/GPS.md).

///         v2, the v1 contract is frozen — `whenNotFrozen` blocks *entry*
///         mutators (new orders, new bids, new registrations) while every
///         *exit and completion* path stays open (cancels, settlement
///         callbacks on in-flight orders, stake withdrawal, vault
///         withdrawal, dispute resolution). In-flight state drains
///         naturally; nothing is ever trapped behind an upgrade.
///
///         `migrate(old)` is the optional state-copy hook (default no-op),
///         called by the router on the NEW contract during promotion.

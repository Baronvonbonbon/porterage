/// @notice Dual-signature GPS attestation verification — the protocol's
///         "proof a delivery physically happened".
///
///         The contract cannot sense location; it verifies that two parties
///         with ADVERSE interests each signed coordinates, and that those
///         coordinates are mutually consistent:
///
///         PICKUP:  driver + venue signer both attest they are at the venue.
///                  Both must be within `pickupRadiusMeters` of the venue's
///                  registered location.
///         DROPOFF: driver + customer both attest the handoff. The customer's
///                  attestation reveals the drop coordinates + salt matching
///                  the `dropCommit` published at order creation; the driver
///                  must be within `dropoffRadiusMeters` of those coordinates.
///
///         Collusion between the cosigners is handled economically (stake,
///         reputation, disputes) — not cryptographically. See docs/GPS.md.
///
///         Anyone may submit a confirmation (both signatures are required
///         anyway), which keeps the path relay-friendly: a driver's phone, a
///         venue tablet, or a gasless relay can carry the transaction.
///
///         Dropoff privacy (ZK): the customer's drop coordinates NEVER touch
///         the chain — not calldata, not storage, not events. `confirmDropoffZK`
///         takes a Groth16 proof (circuits/proximity.circom) that, against the
///         Poseidon `dropCommit` published at order creation, the driver's
///         committed position is within `dropoffRadiusMeters` of the customer's
///         committed position. Both parties' coordinates are private circuit
///         witnesses. The adverse-interest model is preserved: the driver
///         ECDSA-signs a commitment to their OWN position (they won't sign a
///         false one that the proximity proof would then fail), and only the
///         customer can produce the proof (it needs the drop salt, which only
///         they hold) — so the proof is the customer's consent. See docs/GPS.md.

    //   - Its anonymity set was only the seal size, whereas the ZK note path
    //     below gets every unspent note in the tree.
    //   - The keeper held the account↔commitment pairing, so it could substitute
    //     its own commitments. That risk was dormant only because no keeper was
    //     authorized; a single `setShieldKeeper` call re-armed it. A privacy
